# complete-vue-dev-course
This repo contains the projects that I worked on during the Udemy vue course, [Complete Vue Developer Bootcamp (Pinia Vitest)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-vue-js-developer-zero-to-mastery-vuex/) by Zero to Mastery.

The music folder contains the main project and is hosted on vercel ([Music project](https://music-app-paddy-b.vercel.app/)).
